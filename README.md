This Python program demonstrates basic list operations such as creating a list, appending elements, inserting values, extending with another list, removing elements, sorting, and finding the index of an item.

Steps Performed
Create an empty list called my_list.

Append the elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to my_list.

Insert the value 15 at the second position (index 1) in the list.

Extend my_list with another list: [50, 60, 70].

Remove the last element from my_list using pop().

Sort my_list in ascending order.

Find and print the index of the value 30 in my_list.
